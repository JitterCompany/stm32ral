When SPE=1, SPI data transfer is enabled, SPI_CFG1 and SPI_CFG2 configuration registers, CRCPOLY, UDRDR, IOLOCK bit in the SPI_CR1 register are write protected. They can be changed only when SPE=0. When SPE=0 any SPI operation is stopped and disabled, all the pending requests of the events with enabled interrupt are blocked except the MODF interrupt request (but their pending still propagates the request of the spi_plck clock), the SS output is deactivated at master, the RDY signal keeps not ready status at slave, the internal state machine is reseted, all the FIFOs content is flushed, CRC calculation initialized, receive data register is read zero. SPE is cleared and cannot be set when MODF error flag is active.

    /// master automatic suspension in Receive mode This bit is set and cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition. When SPI communication is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay. This is why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared, the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent any subsequent suspension.
