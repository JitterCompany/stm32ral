These bits can be toggled by the software to initialize their value. When the application software writes 0, the value remains unchanged, while writing 1 makes the bit value to toggle. Hardware sets the STATTX bits to NAK, when a correct transfer has occurred (VTTX = 1) corresponding to a IN or SETUP (control only) transaction addressed to this channel/endpoint. It then waits for the software to prepare the next set of data to be transmitted. Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which controls the status based on buffer availability condition (Refer to endpoints and usage in Device mode). If the endpoint is defined as isochronous, its status can only be “VALID” or “DISABLED”. Therefore, the hardware cannot change the status of the channel/endpoint/channel after a successful transaction. If the software sets the STATTX bits to ‘STALL’ or ‘NAK’ for an isochronous channel/endpoint, the USB peripheral behavior is not defined. These bits are read/write but they can be only toggled by writing 1. Host mode The STATTX bits contain the information about the channel status. Refer to for the full descriptions (“Host mode” descriptions). Whereas in Device mode, these bits contain the status that are given out on the following transaction, in Host mode they capture the status last received from the device. If a NAK is received, STATTX contains the value indicating NAK.

Hardware toggles this bit when the ACK handshake is received from the USB host, following a data packet transmission. If the endpoint/channel is defined as a control one, hardware sets this bit to 1 at the reception of a SETUP PID addressed to this endpoint. If the endpoint/channel is using the double buffer feature, this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping too (Refer to Device mode) If the endpoint/channel is isochronous, this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping since no data toggling is used for this sort of endpoints and only DATA0 packet are transmitted (refer to ). Hardware toggles this bit just after the end of data packet transmission, since no handshake is used for isochronous transfers. This bit can also be toggled by the software to initialize its value (mandatory when the endpoint/channel is not a control one) or to force a specific data toggle/packet buffer usage. When the application software writes 0, the value of DTOGTX remains unchanged, while writing 1 makes the bit value to toggle. This bit is read/write but it can only be toggled by writing 1.

DBL_BUF: This bit is set by the software to enable the double-buffering feature for this bulk endpoint. The usage of double-buffered bulk endpoints is explained in Double-buffered endpoints and usage in Device mode. STATUS_OUT: This bit is set by the software to indicate that a status out transaction is expected: in this case all OUT transactions containing more than zero data bytes are answered ‘STALL’ instead of ‘ACK’. This bit may be used to improve the robustness of the application to protocol errors during control transfers and its usage is intended for control endpoints only. When STATUS_OUT is reset, OUT transactions can have any number of bytes, as required.

    /// USB type of transaction These bits configure the behavior of this endpoint/channel as described in Endpoint/channel type encoding. Channel0/Endpoint0 must always be a control endpoint/channel and each USB function must have at least one control endpoint/channel which has address 0, but there may be other control channels/endpoints if required. Only control channels/endpoints handle SETUP transactions, which are ignored by endpoints of other kinds. SETUP transactions cannot be answered with NAK or STALL. If a control endpoint/channel is defined as NAK, the USB peripheral does not answer, simulating a receive error, in the receive direction when a SETUP transaction is received. If the control endpoint/channel is defined as STALL in the receive direction, then the SETUP packet is accepted anyway, transferring data and issuing the CTR interrupt. The reception of OUT transactions is handled in the normal way, even if the endpoint/channel is a control one. Bulk and interrupt endpoints have very similar behavior and they differ only in the special feature available using the EPKIND configuration bit. The usage of isochronous channels/endpoints is explained in transfers in Device mode

    /// Status bits, for reception transfers Device mode These bits contain information about the endpoint status, which are listed in Reception status encoding on page 2492. These bits can be toggled by software to initialize their value. When the application software writes 0, the value remains unchanged, while writing 1 makes the bit value to toggle. Hardware sets the STATRX bits to NAK when a correct transfer has occurred (VTRX = 1) corresponding to a OUT or SETUP (control only) transaction addressed to this endpoint, so the software has the time to elaborate the received data before it acknowledges a new transaction. Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which control the status based upon buffer availability condition (Refer to endpoints and usage in Device mode). If the endpoint is defined as isochronous, its status can be only “VALID” or “DISABLED”, so that the hardware cannot change the status of the endpoint after a successful transaction. If the software sets the STATRX bits to ‘STALL’ or ‘NAK’ for an isochronous endpoint, the USB peripheral behavior is not defined. These bits are read/write but they can be only toggled by writing 1. Host mode These bits are the host application controls to start, retry, or abort host transactions driven by the channel. These bits also contain information about the device answer to the last IN channel transaction and report the current status of the channel according to the following STATRX table of states: - DISABLE DISABLE value is reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a single-buffer channel. When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it is regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated. - VALID A host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction. VALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled. - NAK NAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE - STALL STALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received. When in STALL state the channel behaves as disabled. Application should not retry transmission but reset the USB and re-enumerate.

The USB peripheral handles this event in the following way: During reception an ACK handshake packet is not sent, during transmission a bit-stuff error is forced on the transmitted stream; in both cases the host retries the transaction. The PMAOVR interrupt should never occur during normal operations. Since the failed transaction is retried by the host, the application software has the chance to speed-up device operations during this interrupt handling, to be ready for the next transaction retry; however this does not happen during isochronous transfers (no isochronous transaction is anyway retried) leading to a loss of data in this case.
