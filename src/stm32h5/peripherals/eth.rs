The MAC issues a Packet Abort status, along with the excessive deferral error bit set in the Tx packet status, when the Tx state machine is deferred for more than 24,288 bit times in 10 or 100 Mbps mode. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but it is prevented because of an active carrier sense signal (CRS) on MII. The defer time is not cumulative. For example, if the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times because the CRS signal is active and the CRS signal becomes inactive, the transmitter transmits and collision happens. Because of collision, the transmitter needs to back off and then defer again after back off completion. In such a scenario, the deferral timer is reset to 0, and it is restarted. When this bit is reset, the deferral check function is disabled and the MAC defers until the CRS signal goes inactive. This bit is applicable only in the Half-duplex mode.
